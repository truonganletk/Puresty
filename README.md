## About  

- In 2004, WHO reports and strategies recommended increasing population-level fruit and vegetable consumption to promote health. The WHO/FAO report recommended 400g edible fruit and vegetables per day as a population-wide intake goal. Since then, a lot of annual campaigns have been launched to promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables. 
According to the Vietnam national data in 2020, however, people's fruit and vegetable consumption per capita was just 371.7g/person/day. Knowing this fact, we created and developed Puresty with an aim to promote the consumption of fruits in the Vietnamese’s daily diet.
